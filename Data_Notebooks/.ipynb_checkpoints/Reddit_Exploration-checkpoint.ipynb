For someone who knows what they are doing, these problems take hardly any time at all and it is not really too inconvenient, and for the person hiring it weeds out posers.  In fact sometimes, it is a time to shine. I once took an interview test that had automated unit tests, some that I could run as I coded and some hidden ones that were run after I submitted my final answer. Well, one of the hidden ones failed.  The interviewer was surprised because I had done so well in everything else.

But at the same time, there is a shocking amount of people I have found who has an extensive resume who cannot code trivial problems in a short time.  So I look at these problems as a simple filter.  For someone who knows what they are doing, these problems take hardly any time at all and it is not really too inconvenient, and for the person hiring it weeds out posers.  In fact sometimes, it is a time to shine. I once took an interview test that had automated unit tests, some that I could run as I coded and some hidden ones that were run after I submitted my final answer. Well, one of the hidden ones failed.  The interviewer was surprised because I had done so well in everything else.

The fact that we even have a bi-partisan system means we require some compensation from each side for things to actual function.

The very definition calls out what the problem with most politics, prejudice, and in the US case to the extreme. Libertarians and Green party are just as hostile about their stances and principles. I can admire sticking to what you believe, but these people are sticking to what is best for their pockets and their political capitol. It is a disgrace to imagine that any of them are better than any other. We have leaders that won't even speak to one another unless they are forced to. We have politicians who blindly go along with whatever the party or it's pay pals want. We have arguments over some of the most inane things that should no longer be arguments. Roe v. Wade laid out what constitutes legality. Obergefell v. Hodges decreed that gay marriage and licenses for such are to be made legal in all states in the Union. Religious beliefs are personal and should be left personal unless they are directly harming another's well being and should be left out of government officials politics and official speech. That also goes for personal gain in a monetary or other wise, beyond one's passion for the vision of the Nation and its well being. States rights are important, and they should govern themselves, but their laws must defer to the ultimate court of judgment from the Federal. But nobody is gonna read this and change their mind.

I saved enough to buy tickets for me and my girlfriend, but by the time I had enough, It had sold out and I had to buy from a scalper. I paid him, it was the most money I’ve had. We waited in a line that ran through the whole casino I was so excited I was gonna see them. I got to the front and the tickets didn’t scan. I had em check it 5 times. I asked if they could be bad or somehow damaged, they said “no, they’re fake”. I immediately broke down crying in front of my girlfriend and in front of everyone.

They walked down from the hotel to the mall instead of taking a cab and crowds of people followed them around gawking at him and chappelle just acted like it wasn’t a big deal. When they got back to the hotel people even followed them inside and tried to get in the elevator with them and some lady got past hotel security and jumped in the elevator and snapped a selfie with him and jumped back out and the guy asked him “does this shit not piss you off? I would have punched that lady in the face.” And chappelle just calmly replied “eh, what are u gonna do?”\n",

I believe but I cannot find any stats that support you or me, that the majority that choose and are able to stay away- not seek out their drug even if they know they can, no matter how easy on the streets or at a center are better helped by having the resources available. And overall the pro outweigh the con. More people are helped by centers than not.

I understand when you say making the availability easy for a drug user ( even if move to a new city to get away can relapse by making connections going to a clinic)- about as easy as an alcoholic who can go almost anywhere for a drink. But the constant reminder that there is help, which they won't get in a drug den, reenforces the idea that help is easily available when they want it as easy as it is to use it is easy to get help. (no matter how many times they need it). So does it make getting drugs easier/sobriety harder? For those that truly want to / can't help but relapse/use yes. It is harder for those already addicted to stay sober than someone who has never used to stay sober. It is a double edge sword but I believe the pros still out weigh the con.\n",
